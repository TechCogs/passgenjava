# passgenjava

This is the Java version of the simple PassGen password generation utility.  This version was created as a comparison to the D version and the Python version.

Because the Passgenjava class is part of the passgenjava package, after compiling the code in order to run it make sure you're outside of the passgenjava directory, such as "java passgenjava.Passgenjava".  Optionally you can edit the code and change the name of the package if you'd like.
